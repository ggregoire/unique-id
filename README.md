Unique ID?
==========
* Counts the number of occurrences of your HTML ids and classes.
* Checks if each id is unique.

Why?
====

W3C recommendation:
> The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element.
> The id attribute has several roles in HTML:
> * As a style sheet selector.
> * As a target anchor for hypertext links.
> * As a means to reference a particular element from a script.
